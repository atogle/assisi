Assisi
======

Assisi is a platform for collecting requests first for Liberti Church's Easter
Outreach. The goal is to start with a simple API for writing "requests" to a
database and build lightweight clients on top of it. Examples could include
web forms, SMS, or voice.

This is an early prototype. Be ye warned.
